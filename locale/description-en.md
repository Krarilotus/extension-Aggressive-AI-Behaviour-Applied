# Aggressive AI Behaviour

Developed by **Krarilotus**, the Aggressive AI Behaviour plugin enhances AI performance by progressively strengthening it, ensuring early attacks while maintaining adherence to Vanilla game characteristics. This plugin makes the AI more active on the map, deploying a larger variety of troops and gradually integrating additional unit types as the game advances.

Considerable efforts have been made to fix bugs that previously prevented the AI from attacking effectively, by removing problematic unit groups and significantly reducing AI errors. The AI's economy has been optimized for maximum efficiency without sacrificing its unique traits; for instance, the Pig continues to exclusively build dairy farms.

This AI Behaviour plugin offers a challenging gameplay experience and is ideally paired with the Vanilla Interpretation Castles. Together, they provide a reworked and unique challenge for the player in the 2nd Vanilla skirmish trail, dubbed Vanilla Retraced.

Previously known as "Krarilotus-aggressive-AIC," this plugin applies the files of the Aggressive AI Behaviour plugin to each Vanilla AI respectively.
